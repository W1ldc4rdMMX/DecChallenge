============


Please note the project is still incomplete.
It's still very buggy and does not do what was
intended.

I mainly submitted it to get a view if my understanding
of Symfony and coding practice has been right thus far.
  
  
**Intended purpose**

This was meant to be a stock management system which would
record the details of the products in stock, purchases as well
as report on stock movement.
Meta data would have been stored about the user who logged in, 
orders they processed, edits made etc.
